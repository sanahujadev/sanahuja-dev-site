      "content": "During three intense years of Computer Engineering at Simón Bolívar University, I acquired an analytical mindset and a problem-solving approach that I apply to web development today. But I discovered that the real learning is in building things that work in the real world. That's why I trained in over 108 specialized courses in modern web development, from front-end technologies to performance optimization. Then came my time on Fiverr, where I executed 13 international projects with a perfect 5★ rating. There I learned the most important thing: code is important, but trust is even more so.",
